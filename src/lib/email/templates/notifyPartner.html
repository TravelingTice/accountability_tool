		<p>Dear {{partnerName}},</p>
		<p>
			Your friend {{name}} has made a pledge on
			<a href="https://doitorelse.net">https://doitorelse.net</a> stating that they will achieve a
			goal by a certain deadline. Here are those details:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Goal: {{goal}}</li>
			<li>Deadline: {{deadline}}</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			On the day of the deadline, we're sending another email in which you can say if {{name}} has
			achieved this goal or not.
		</p>
		<p>
			If {{name}} <strong>doesn't</strong> achieve their goal,
			<strong>{{name}} will donate ${{amount}} to {{consequence}}.</strong> So please keep {{name}}
			accountable to make sure they will reach their goal!
		</p>
		<p>Thanks for doing this great service.</p>
		<p>Best regards,<br />Tice from <a href="https://doitorelse.net">https://doitorelse.net</a></p>
