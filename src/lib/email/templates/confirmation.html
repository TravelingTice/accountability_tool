		<p>Dear {{name}},</p>
		<p>
			Congratulations on making your pledge and linking the immense pain of donating to
			{{consequence}} to it! This is a huge step to put such a negative consequence on the line of
			achieving your goal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now don't sit around any longer, and actually start working on your goal! You've put a huge
			consequence on the line!
		</p>
		<p>
			On {{deadline}}, your accountability partner {{partnerName}} will receive an email in which
			they can say if you achieved your goal or not, so please be sure they are aware of your pledge
			and make sure to be available so they can check on you and your goal's progress.
		</p>
		<p>Here is one last overview of your pledge:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Goal: {{goal}}</li>
			<li>Deadline: {{deadline}}</li>
			<li>Consequence: {{fullConsequence}}</li>
			<li>Accountability partner: {{partnerName}} (email: {{partnerEmail}})</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Best of luck on achieving greatness.</p>
