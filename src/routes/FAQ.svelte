			<dd>
				<p>
					First you pick a goal you really want to achieve. It's super important to you but you
					haven't been able to achieve it and you keep failing at it. Whether it's finally getting
					that sixpack or finally fixing your relationship. Whatever it is. As long as it's a goal
					you are really willing to put a bad consequence on when not following through on your
					goal. Also make sure you are 100% in control of succeeding at the goal. Like for example
					when your goal depends on the action or opinions of others, that doesn't work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then you pick a consequence that you really don't want to happen. There are 5 consequences
					you can pick from. They are all organization or charity donations. Depending on your
					identity and values, pick the one that sounds the most painful for you. Like for example
					you'd never identity as a Trump supporter. Put your identity on the line and become a
					Trump supporter if you don't follow through on your goal.
				</p>
				<p>
					After this, you also pick an accountability partner. This person will have to let the app
					know if you followed through on your goal on your set deadline. If not, the amount you
					paid will be donated to the organisation or charity of your choice. If you did follow
					through you get a refund of your donation.
				</p>

		<div>
			<dt><h3>Does all my money get donated if I don't follow through?</h3></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					No. 5% will go to the website owner and maintainer. This money is also not refundable. So
					either you get 95% of the donation back if you reach your goal, or this share gets donated
					to the cause you picked.
				</p>
			</dd>
		</div>

		<div>
			<dt><h3>What if Iâ€™m not sure if I can follow through on my goal?</h3></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Be very careful with the goal you choose. You don't want to make it too vague or too
					unreachable. When creating your goal on here, you also get guidance on what kind of
					criteria your goal should adhere to. If you're going to link massive pain to your goal,
					you will be a lot more motivated to follow through, so make sure the goal you choose is
					approachable and doesn't lead you to many sleepless nights and unnecessary stress.

		<div>
			<dt><h3>Is there any way to refund the money?</h3></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Only if you follow through on your goal. So go ahead and do it!!</p>
